ModifierHander goes on gameobjects which can take a modifier. This can be players, npcs, trees, rocks, and...
...even game managers (such as a +20% damage modifier for all spawned enemeis, due to level difficulty or whatever)

ModifierService needs be instanciated as a manager somewhere (may refactor for lazy instanciation)

The Modifiers folder is empty because I have not needed any modifiers aside from the base one.
